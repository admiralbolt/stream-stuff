Barbie Horse Adventure: Wild Horse Rescue
=========================================
- For a game about horses, the actual horse handling is complete garbage. Hit
  boxes are WAY bigger than their visuals, horses have terrible turn control,
  and handle poorly in tight spaces.
- The load screens are absolutely brutal, loading the main hub takes ~20 seconds
  and even just leaving to change your costume (load screen for that btw)
  requires reloading the hub.
- Story is non existent, animation quality is terrible, voice acting is bad.
+ The only redeeming quality, is that you can say you beat
  Barbie Horse Adventure: Wild Horse Rescue.

3/10

Link: The Faces of Evil
========================
- The game handles incredibly poorly and punishes you
  incredibly hard for missing tight windows.
- The game has platformer elements despite the platforming
  being garbage, and several that kill you instantly if
  you mess them up.
- Setting up the emulator to play this game took like 2
  hours of testing and digging through several year old
  reddit posts.
- Visuals are really bad, impossible to see where you are
  supposed to go, often times leading you to death if you
  guess incorrectly.
- Noodles are too OP, really short things in general are
  nearly impossible to hit, often times depending on the
  slope of the ground you just can't hit small enemies.
- The Bell is useless.
- Transitioning between items takes forever as well...
+ The cutscenes are hilarious. Honestly the only reason to
  keep playing the game.
+ Soundtrack is actually kinda fire, for like a 90's
  chiptune thing.
+ SOME of the puzzles are actually kinda clever.

4/10

Pears And Gray Witch
=====================
- Platforming game with terrible controls.
- Incredibly Buggy
- Lots of load screens
- Technically demanding despite having terrible controls.
- Most levels are uninteresting, and are just there to
  waste your time.
- Last level is impossible to complete.
- No real story, ending cutscene is nothing.
- Technically costs $5.
+ The dialogue can be funny because it is poorly
  translated sometimes.
