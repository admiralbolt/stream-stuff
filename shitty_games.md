Barbie Horse Adventure: Wild Horse Rescue
=========================================
- For a game about horses, the actual horse handling is complete garbage. Hit
  boxes are WAY bigger than their visuals, horses have terrible turn control,
  and handle poorly in tight spaces.
- The load screens are absolutely brutal, loading the main hub takes ~20 seconds
  and even just leaving to change your costume (load screen for that btw)
  requires reloading the hub.
+ You can pet the horses.
