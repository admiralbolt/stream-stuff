Barbie Horse Adventure: Wild Horse Rescue
=========================================
- For a game about horses, the actual horse handling is complete garbage. Hit
  boxes are WAY bigger than their visuals, horses have terrible turn control,
  and handle poorly in tight spaces.
- The load screens are absolutely brutal, loading the main hub takes ~20 seconds
  and even just leaving to change your costume (load screen for that btw)
  requires reloading the hub.
- Story is non existent, animation quality is terrible, voice acting is bad.
+ The only redeeming quality, is that you can say you beat
  Barbie Horse Adventure: Wild Horse Rescue.
