Legitimately Good Ideas
========================
* Timestamper
* Control stream information / start-streaming from control-panel
* Should probably re-write the socket server / data storage so that connecting
  clients actually get sent some kind of default instead of relying on the
  control panel to send data after a client has connected. (Currently causing
    problems with the brain plugin on initial load)
* Storm Clouds for the splash screen.
* Players Plugin: Show player names, icons, maybe port? Support N players maybe?
* Rewrite audio using pydub / support other file types.

PURE GOLD
==========
* Control the stream with my eyebrows.
* Voice Commands to control the stream Ex: Saying "clip that" clips that.

Garbage?
